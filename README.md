# Introduction to the Workshop {-}


Are you looking to improve your text analysis skills using R? This introductory session will focus on setting up efficient workflows for analysing language data in R and RStudio. The workshop is ideal for participants with basic R skills who want to explore how R can be applied to text analysis. In this hands-on session, you will learn:

* How to properly configure R and RStudio for text analysis projects  
* Techniques for loading, cleaning, and processing language data in R  
* How to generate concordances (keyword-in-context displays) to better understand word usage in context  
* Methods for extracting collocations and identifying keywords in your dataset  

This session will focus on best practices and optimal workflows, helping you work more efficiently and accurately when processing language data. Whether you're a linguist, social scientist, or researcher in the humanities, this workshop will give you the skills to get the most out of your data analysis in R.
